# Telegram_bot_VIIBE

---

IF YOU WILL CLONE THIS REPOSITORY, BOT WILL NOT WORK SINCE APIs REQUIRED TG BOT ARE NOT SPECIFIED!!!

---

This is my first (almost-?) user-friendly project related to strategy simulation of financial data series. I also implemented database using SQL and challenged myself in learning new libraries to find out how fast I will be able to master them

I also got introduced with another side (much darker side actually :) ) of Python programming, when I had to build my own class to process more complex users' queries.

If you want to try the functionality of this bot, contact me through email (dimensionkernel@gmail.com with email title starting from "[BOT_TG]", otherwise I will not recieve you message because it will be sent to spam folder) or telegram (https://t.me/DIMensionKER).

Keep in mind that this project is currently in progress, so I will be very greatful if you provide me with any informative feedback about bugs and interesting ideas and features to implement.

Sincerely yours,
ShirshovDIM
